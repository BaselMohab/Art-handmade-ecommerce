# Artix
This project is built using React with Vite, ensuring fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and a minimal setup. The frontend is styled with Tailwind CSS and manages application state using Redux Toolkit and React Redux. The backend is powered by Node.js and MongoDB, providing a scalable and efficient API and database management system.

## My Contributions:
- Implemented Redux throughout the entire app for effective state management.
- Developed multiple core pages with responsive, mobile-friendly designs using Tailwind CSS.
- Integrated Redux Thunks to handle asynchronous operations like API calls to the backend for CRUD functionality.
- Created and managed Redux Slices for user authentication, product management, and cart functionality.

## Backend Overview:
- Built the backend using Node.js and Express.js for the server, ensuring a scalable and efficient API.
- Used MongoDB as the database to manage data related to users, products, and orders.
- Developed several RESTful API endpoints for handling requests such as product fetching, user authentication, and order management.
- Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure login and protected routes.

Vite Plugins:
We used the following official Vite plugins for optimizing the React app:

- @vitejs/plugin-react for Babel-based Fast Refresh.
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc as an alternative for SWC-based Fast Refresh.
